            <h1>About Me</h1>

             <p>

                I was born and raised in Muncy, PA.  At the age of 8, my family and I moved to Tennessee where I've lived ever since.
                At the age of 10 I received my first guitar, and started taking lessons at the age of 11.  Over the years, I picked up
                bass, drums, mandolins, and a little bit of piano as well.  I graduated with a degree in Audio Engineering and released
                my first album "Last Words" in 2016 which I wrote, recorded, and engineered on my own.

                Aside from music, I'm also an avid video game collector.  I own around 1,500 games/consoles spanning from 1976 to now.  
                I started a Youtube channel in 2017 which I discuss my video game collection along with fun skits I do on my own or with
                friends.  I'm excited about starting a new career as a web developer.  I plan on having my own website up by the 
                beginning of next year that will include all of my music and video projects.
